# PyTrader
pytrader.py is an unofficial class wrapper for Ally Invest (tradeking) API.

I include sample.py to demo the use of PyTrader class. It will need a configuration file in YAML format with the following information.

account.yaml
```
account : your_account_number
auth :
    app_key : your_app_key
    app_secret : your_app_secret
    token : your_token
    token_secret : your_token_secret
```

Use at your own risk. I do not take any responsibility and I am not liable for any damage caused through use of any codes in this repository. Questions and feedback are always welcome.
